Buster.JS ships with a set of built-in reporters. These can be used by
providing the name to the -r/--reporter option:

buster-test -r dots

The dots reporter is the default reporter. Built-in reporters
include: <%= reporters.join("\n") %>

Custom reporters

Buster.JS can use custom reporters that are reachable through the node
module system. Assume you have a reporter that looks like:

module.exports = {
    create: function (options) {
        // ...
    },

    listen: function (runner) {
        // ...
    },

    // ...
};

When this reporter is available on the node load path, say in the
`my-reporter` module, you can use it the following way:

`buster-test -r my-reporter`

The BUSTER_REPORTER environment variable

If you want a different reporter, but don't want to specify it for each
run, you can specify the BUSTER_REPORTER environment variable in e.g.,
.bashrc and Buster will use this reporter as long as another one is not
specified with the -r option.
